# Unified LLM Timeout Retry Design

## Problem

LambChat currently configures both provider SDKs and an agent middleware with the
same 120-second timeout. These deadlines race. More importantly, the middleware
wraps the complete `ainvoke()` call. LangChain does not return from `ainvoke()`
until all streamed chunks have been merged, so a healthy response that starts
within 120 seconds but streams for longer is incorrectly cancelled.

When the application-side `asyncio.wait_for` wins, the resulting `TimeoutError`
is retried. When an SDK first raises a transport-specific timeout such as
`httpx.ReadTimeout`, the current predicate may classify it as non-retryable and
stop after one attempt.

Retry behavior is also split across the agent middleware and several direct
model invocation helpers. Those paths disagree about whether
`LLM_MAX_RETRIES=3` means three total attempts or three retries after the first
attempt. Provider SDK retries can additionally multiply application retries.

## Goals

- Retry every model timeout, regardless of which supported provider, transport,
  proxy, or application deadline produced it.
- Limit the wait for a response to 120 seconds without imposing a total duration
  or idle timeout after the first streamed chunk arrives.
- Define `LLM_MAX_RETRIES=3` as one initial attempt plus three retries, for four
  total attempts.
- Apply the same timeout and retry contract to agent, subagent, grader, and
  direct model invocation paths.
- Avoid nested SDK and application retry multiplication.
- Make retries observable without logging prompts, URLs, credentials, response
  bodies, or exception text.
- Preserve immediate failure for permanent errors and cancellation.

## Non-goals

- Retrying authentication, authorization, malformed request, unsupported model,
  or not-found errors.
- Changing model selection, fallback selection, prompt content, streaming event
  ordering, or tool execution behavior.
- Timing out a stream after it has emitted its first chunk, even if no later
  chunk arrives for an arbitrarily long period.
- Adding a new general-purpose retry dependency.

## Chosen Architecture

### Canonical retry policy

A focused module under `src/infra/llm/` will own:

- recursive exception-chain inspection;
- timeout and transient-error classification;
- attempt-count semantics;
- exponential backoff with the existing configured delay; and
- sanitized retry logging.

Exception inspection will traverse `__cause__`, `__context__`, and nested
exception groups without looping. It will recognize:

- built-in and asyncio timeout errors;
- all HTTPX timeout types, including connect, read, write, and pool timeouts;
- OpenAI and Anthropic timeout and transient connection/status wrappers;
- Google deadline and transport timeout wrappers when their optional packages
  are installed; and
- supported wrapper exceptions whose causal chain contains one of the above.

Existing explicitly transient proxy responses and 429/5xx behavior remain
retryable. Cancellation remains outside the retry contract.

### Response timeout semantics

For a streaming invocation, the 120-second deadline ends when the first model
chunk arrives. The application then waits for the stream to finish without a
total-duration or inter-chunk idle deadline. This intentionally means that a
stream which emits one chunk and then remains silent is not cancelled by
LambChat; only an explicit user cancellation, process shutdown, or transport
failure ends it.

For a non-streaming invocation there is no chunk boundary, so completion is the
first response and must occur within 120 seconds.

Each provider adapter wraps only the first `anext()` call on its asynchronous
model stream with the configured deadline. The adapter then yields every later
event directly from the provider iterator. A non-streaming provider call wraps
the complete model coroutine instead.

### Agent middleware

The main agent, all subagents, and rubric grader use LangChain's official
`ModelRetryMiddleware`, configured with the canonical retry predicate. The
provider adapter raises `TimeoutError` if the first model event misses the
deadline, and the official middleware performs the retry. A fallback model
remains outside the primary retry layer, so it is selected only after the
primary model exhausts its retries.

Empty or truncated response handling remains separate from exception retries so
the existing response-validation behavior is preserved.

### Direct model calls

All direct `ainvoke` call sites created through `LLMClient` will use the shared
retry runner or attach the shared middleware where the call builds an agent.
The inventory includes:

- session title generation;
- recommendation generation;
- main-agent context preparation;
- subagent result/activity processing;
- native memory summaries, consolidation, and backend model calls;
- automatic memory compaction agents; and
- image analysis.

Callers with a dedicated retry setting may override the retry count, but the
value consistently means retries after the initial attempt. Otherwise they use
`LLM_MAX_RETRIES`.

Direct non-streaming calls apply the deadline to the complete call. Streaming
calls receive the same first-event behavior from the provider adapter and must
not wrap consumption of the complete iterator in `asyncio.wait_for`.

### Provider SDK configuration

Provider SDK retries are disabled so application retries are the sole
attempt-count authority. OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, and Google SDK-level
request timeouts are disabled because they either apply to every read or to the
whole request. LambChat's provider adapters supply the authoritative first-event
deadline, while non-streaming calls retain a completion deadline.

Transport exceptions that still occur are classified by the canonical policy.
This preserves retry behavior without allowing an SDK timeout to truncate an
already-started stream.

### Configuration and cache behavior

`LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` will be exposed alongside the existing LLM retry settings
and documented in English and Chinese. A runtime change to this setting must
invalidate cached model clients because timeout is part of their construction
and cache key.

## Error and Logging Contract

For a retryable failure, logs contain only:

- a stable operation label;
- exception class name;
- failed attempt and total attempts;
- retry delay; and
- whether the failure was classified as a timeout.

Logs must not contain `str(exception)`, prompts, messages, provider URLs, model
credentials, response bodies, or signed file URLs. After retries are exhausted,
the original final exception is raised so existing fallback and user-facing
error handling continue to work.

## Testing Strategy

Development follows red-green-refactor.

1. Add a failing regression test showing raw HTTPX read/connect timeouts receive
   four attempts when `LLM_MAX_RETRIES=3`.
2. Cover write/pool timeouts, provider timeout wrappers, causal-chain wrapping,
   and optional Google timeout types.
3. Verify permanent errors make one attempt and `CancelledError` is propagated
   immediately.
4. Verify a stream that emits its first chunk before the deadline may run longer
   than the configured timeout and may remain silent afterward without being
   cancelled.
5. Verify a stream that emits no first chunk is cancelled and retried, while a
   non-streaming call must complete before the deadline.
6. Verify the final exception is retained and retry logs are present and
   secret-safe.
7. Verify agent middleware ordering keeps retry inside fallback and applies to
   both primary and fallback models.
8. Replace duplicated direct-call loops and add focused behavioral tests for
   their retry-count semantics.
9. Verify provider clients use zero SDK retries, do not enforce a streaming read
   or request-wide deadline, and runtime timeout changes clear cached clients.
10. Run focused tests, the relevant backend test groups, Ruff, Mypy, and the full
   repository check when the environment permits it.

## Success Criteria

- Every supported model timeout path performs the initial call plus the
  configured number of retries.
- A stream must start within 120 seconds, but after its first chunk it has no
  LambChat total-duration or inter-chunk idle timeout.
- With defaults, a repeatedly timing-out call makes exactly four application
  attempts, never one and never a multiplicative SDK/application count.
- Fixed errors and cancellation are never retried.
- Primary retry exhaustion still triggers configured fallback behavior.
- Retry diagnostics are visible and contain no sensitive request or exception
  payloads.
- All changed-path tests, lint, and type checks pass; broader failures, if any,
  are independently isolated and reported.
